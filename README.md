# MethodSelector
An exercise in using the Envoy pattern language.  A simple banking application in C# is created to demonstrate the pattern.  This demonstration is using a framework as discussed in Ted Neward's excellent blog located at http://blogs.tedneward.com.
The MethodSelector class is the start of the framework and it mushroomed from there.

The application is dual in nature in that it is a combination of a console application and a WPF GUI.  This is controlled with a command-line option '-G'.
